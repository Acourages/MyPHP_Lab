# PHP Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of small-scale PHP projects that I’ve built to explore new concepts, practice my skills, and demonstrate practical problem-solving using PHP. These mini projects cover a variety of real-world applications, such as consuming APIs, working with form data, and building lightweight web tools.

Whether you're a beginner looking for learning inspiration or someone exploring simple PHP-based solutions, this repo offers a range of ideas and clean code examples.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

Instead of creating a separate repository for every small project, I’ve bundled them into this single collection. It helps keep things organized while still making each mini project easy to browse and run independently.

## 📌 Notes

- Each project is isolated in its own folder with a simple structure for easy testing and experimentation.
- All code is written with clarity and simplicity in mind, making it easy to understand and modify.
- More projects will be added over time as I explore new ideas or practice new techniques.
