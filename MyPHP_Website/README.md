## ✨ Welcome!

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills and projects as a Junior Software Engineer. It's built with PHP for dynamic content and routing, styled with custom CSS, and features some interactive elements with JavaScript.


## 🚀 Features

* **Clean and Responsive Design:** Built with a focus on user experience across different devices.
* **Dynamic Content:** Utilizes PHP to load page content and project data dynamically.
* **Project Showcase:** A dedicated section will highlight my projects with descriptions and links.
* **About Me:** An introduction to my background, skills, and aspirations.
* **Contact Form:** An Easy way for visitors to get in touch.
* **Simple Routing:** Implemented using PHP and .htaccess for clean URLs.
* **Basic Styling:** Custom CSS for a unique and professional look.
* **Interactive Elements:** Includes a responsive navigation menu and potential for further JavaScript enhancements.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **PHP:** For server-side logic and dynamic content handling.
* **HTML:** Semantic markup for the structure of the website.
* **CSS:** Custom stylesheets (`style.css`) for visual presentation.
* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and potential animations (e.g., hamburger menu).
* **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** (If you're using it) Library for on-scroll animations.
* **Potentially:**
    * **GitHub Pages or other hosting platform:** For deploying the live website.
    * **Image optimization tools:** For optimizing project images.
